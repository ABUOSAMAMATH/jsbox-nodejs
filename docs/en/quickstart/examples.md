# Examples

In order to make the Node.js runtime more easier to master, we prepared some example projects.

Also, they are hosted on the GitHub, since we don't want to bundle them in the app. What you need to do is clone them, and follow the instructions.

- [youtube-dl](https://github.com/cyanzhong/jsbox-youtube-dl): A simple YouTube downloader
- [cheerio](https://github.com/cyanzhong/jsbox-cheerio): Use `cheerio` in JSBox
- [ts-playground](https://github.com/cyanzhong/jsbox-ts-playground): Transpile TypeScript to JavaScript
- [browserify](https://github.com/cyanzhong/jsbox-browserify): Bundle node modules for JSBox using `browserify`
- [pdfkit](https://github.com/cyanzhong/jsbox-pdfkit): Render photos as PDF using `pdfkit`
- [local-web-server](https://github.com/cyanzhong/jsbox-local-web-server): A simple local web server

We are planning to bring more examples, as a good way to understand the JSBox Node.js runtime.
